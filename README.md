<b>Why is this application needed?</b>

How often have you forgotten about something, how often have you missed some important dates, forgotten to watch some online broadcast of someone’s birthday, called the tax office on Thursday, sent a letter to a friend in the morning? This is a telegram application that will notify you about events that are important to you so that you do not forget about them. Just enter the text for the reminder and some other data, the application will start working. It will be useful for absolutely everyone. The fully functional version of the application is now available here https://t.me/reminder_app3_bot

<b>Peculiarities</b>

On the backend side, python with the tornado framework plus aiogram is used. The frontend is written in javascript with the jquery library and the tailwindcss css framework. The mysql database is used (although it was possible to get by with regular files).
The application has been translated into several languages, including: English, German, Russian and Korean. Depending on what language is configured on the user’s device, the application will be displayed in the appropriate language; if the language is not found (for example, the user’s language is Chinese), then the application is displayed in English by default.
All commands for the terminal that you will see below according to the instructions will be made for the Debian operating system.
